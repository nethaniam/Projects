#Summary
This projects uses code from https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ to simulate a shell. I adapted the code to contain 
more builtin functions like changing the user, creating a directory, creating a file, opening a file in its original app, 
deleting a file, and showing all the files is a directory.
